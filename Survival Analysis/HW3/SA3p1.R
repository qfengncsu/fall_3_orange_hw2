### concordance

# create data frame with the event, time, martingale residuals, deviance
# residuals, and ID variable

                     ID = 1:length(residuals(fit)))
# martingale vs. time
ggplot(resids, aes(x = time, y = res_m, color = factor(event))) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "week", y = "martingale residuals", color = "event") +

# or you can just find the observation corresponding to the max deviance res.
which.max(resids$res_d) # it's observation 101

### dfbetas

# i'm now making the binary variables categorical
# i don't really know why, it won't change the estimates but I guess it's
# good for you to see how to deal with them anyway?

### stratification: checking PH

### fit model with time-dependent coefficient
# let's use log(t) as an example using tt() within coxph()
# here you can define this time transform as whatever function you want

### time-dependent variables
# load new datasets

### coxph() gives wrong r^2 using counting process:
# using the long data, i am going to make a model excluding the employed
# variable, so it's the EXACT same model we've used all along
fit2 <- coxph(Surv(start, stop, arrested == 1) ~ fin + age + race + wexp +
                mar + paro + prio, data = recid_long)
summary(fit2)
# notice that the estimates are the same, but R^2 is not!
concordance(fit2) # concordance works correctly, though
